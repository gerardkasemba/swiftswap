SwiftSwap Backend Developer Guide

## Overview

SwiftSwap is a delivery service platform that helps buyers and sellers in used marketplace transactions (e.g., Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp) by providing reliable pick-up and delivery services. This document outlines the backend requirements and workflows for SwiftSwap, including payment processing, SMS notifications, database management, and hosting.

## Technology Stack

- **Payment Processing:** Square (squareup.com)
- **SMS Notifications:** Twilio (twilio.com)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Hosting:** Google Cloud

## Key Features

1. **Order Creation:** Buyers create an order on SwiftSwap, providing details about the item and the delivery/pick-up locations.
2. **Seller Form:** Sellers fill out a form to schedule the pick-up date and time and specify their payment method.
3. **Notifications:** Buyers receive SMS notifications at key stages (order completion, driver on route, delivery completion).
4. **Payment:** Buyers make payments through Square after the order is confirmed by the seller

### Order Creation

1. **Buyer Form:**
   - Buyer provides their information, delivery address, and item details.
   - Data is saved to the MongoDB database.
   - A pre-written message with a unique link is generated for the buyer to send to the seller via the marketplace platform.

### Seller Form

1. **Seller Scheduling:**
   - Seller clicks the link and fills out a form to schedule a pick-up date/time and select their payment method.
   - Data is saved to the MongoDB database.
   - Buyer receives an SMS notification via Twilio, informing them that the order is completed with a link to view the summary and make a payment.

### Notifications

1. **Order Completion:**
   - After the seller completes the form, Twilio sends an SMS to the buyer with the order summary link.
   
2. **Driver On Route:**
   - When a driver is en route to pick up the package, Twilio sends an SMS to the buyer.
   
3. **Delivery Completion:**
   - Once the package is delivered, Twilio sends an SMS to the buyer with an image of the delivered package.

### Payment Processing

1. **Payment Integration:**
   - Square's payment gateway is used for processing payments.
   - After viewing the order summary, the buyer can make a payment through the provided link.
